# Outlier-analysis
Method for solving outliers of one-dimensional data / spectral data.

    The method used in this project is Median Absolute Deviation.  
      Step 1: calculate the average value and standard deviation of the factor.
      Step 2:Calculate the relative deviation of each factor from the median - ABS.
      Step 3:The median mad of absolute deviation is calculated.
      Step 4:Determine the parameter n, select the range [max_range, min_rainge], and replace the value out of range.
